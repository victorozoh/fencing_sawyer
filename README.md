=============================

#### *Victor Ozoh -- MS in Robotics Final Project - Northwestern University*


## Overview
The goal of this project is to explore a few topics related to the synthesis of
Robotics and Virtual Reality.
Some of those topics include:
- Human-Robot interaction via virtual reality. For example Tele-operation.
- Robot Learning via Virtual Reality

## Components and Tools
- ROS
- Unity 3D
- HTC Vive Virtual Reality System
- Baxter Robot, TurtleBot3 etc

## Package References
